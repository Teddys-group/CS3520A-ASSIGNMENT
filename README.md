**2-BIT BINARY ADDER**

2-bit binary adder is a mini-project that adds only 2-bit binary numbers and produce a 3-bit binary number as an output.It provides a solution that is more accurate than when adding manually.

The objective is to design, simulate and document a digital circuit that implements the functionality of a 2-bit binary adder using basic digital logic gate.
